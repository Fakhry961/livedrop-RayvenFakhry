After submitting, a verification email is sent; users must verify within 24 hours or the registration token expires. Shoplite supports two primary account types: Buyer and Seller. Buyer accounts are free and enable browsing, buying, saving favorites, writing reviews, and tracking orders. Seller accounts require additional business information: company name, registration ID/tax ID, bank or payout information, and a short description of the seller's product categories.\n",

Two-factor authentication (2FA) via SMS or authenticator apps is optional but recommended for sellers.
