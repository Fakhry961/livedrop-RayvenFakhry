# LiveDrops ‚Äî Flash-Sale & Follow Platform

## üìå Overview
LiveDrops is a system where creators can run limited-inventory live product drops.  
Users can follow creators, receive near real-time notifications when drops start or stock changes, browse products, and place secure orders without overselling.  

This design prioritizes **scalability**, **low-latency reads**, and **idempotent order handling** to handle sudden traffic spikes from popular creators.

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Model Sketches

### Users & Follows
- **Users**
  - `user_id (PK)`
  - `name`
  - `email`
- **Follows**
  - `follower_id (FK ‚Üí Users.user_id)`
  - `creator_id (FK ‚Üí Users.user_id)`
  - Composite PK ‚Üí (`follower_id`, `creator_id`)

### Creators & Drops
- **Creators**
  - `creator_id (PK)`
  - `profile_name`
- **Drops**
  - `drop_id (PK)`
  - `creator_id (FK ‚Üí Creators.creator_id)`
  - `product_id (FK ‚Üí Products.product_id)`
  - `start_time`, `end_time`
  - `stock_count`

### Products & Orders
- **Products**
  - `product_id (PK)`
  - `title`, `description`, `price`
- **Orders**
  - `order_id (PK)`
  - `user_id (FK ‚Üí Users.user_id)`
  - `drop_id (FK ‚Üí Drops.drop_id)`
  - `status` (pending, confirmed, failed)
  - `created_at`
  - `idempotency_key` (to prevent duplicates)

## üì° API Contract Outline

### Public API (for mobile/web clients)
- **User / Follow**
  - `POST /users/{id}/follow/{creatorId}`
  - `DELETE /users/{id}/follow/{creatorId}`
  - `GET /users/{id}/following`
  - `GET /creators/{id}/followers`
- **Products / Drops**
  - `GET /products?page=n`
  - `GET /drops/live`
  - `GET /drops/{id}`
- **Orders**
  - `POST /orders`  
    Request includes `drop_id`, `quantity`, `idempotency_key`
  - `GET /orders/{id}`

### Internal APIs / Events
- `drop.started`, `drop.soldout`, `stock.low`, `order.confirmed` ‚Üí published via **Kafka**.  
- **Notification workers** consume these events to send push notifications in near real time.

## ‚ö° Caching & Invalidation
- **Redis** used for:
  - Hot product details, stock counts, and creator profiles.
  - Paginated follower lists (sharded to avoid hot-spotting on celebrity creators).
- **Invalidation Strategy**:
  - On stock update or order confirmation ‚Üí update DB (source of truth), then invalidate Redis cache entry.
  - Write-through cache for product reads.
  - Event-driven invalidation for follower updates.

## üîë Key Design Decisions & Tradeoffs
- **SQL for Orders & Inventory**  
  Ensures strong consistency and no overselling. Inventory updates use row-level locking or atomic counters.  

- **NoSQL for Follows (sharded by creator_id)**  
  Enables fast fan-out for large celebrity accounts with millions of followers.  

- **Kafka for Event Distribution**  
  Decouples drop/stock/order events from notification delivery and analytics.  

- **Idempotent Orders**  
  `idempotency_key` prevents double orders from retries.  

- **Scalability**  
  - Horizontally scalable stateless API servers behind load balancer.  
  - CDN for static content.  
  - Caching layer reduces DB load.  

- **Reliability**  
  - Notifications guaranteed via retry queues.  
  - Orders never oversell via DB-level constraints.  
  - System resilient to single-node failures.  

---

## üìä Metrics & Observability
- Track **request volume, latency (p95)**, **cache hit ratio**, **DB lock contention**, **notification delivery times**.  
- Centralized logging and monitoring dashboards (Grafana/Prometheus).

## Quick start ‚Äî run the storefront and Storybook locally

Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (LTS)
- pnpm installed globally:
  ```bash
  npm install -g pnpm
  ```

Install dependencies
- From repo root (or directly inside the app):
  ```bash
  cd apps/storefront
  pnpm install
  ```

Run the dev app
- Start the Vite dev server:
  ```bash
  pnpm dev
  ```
- Open http://localhost:5173

Run Storybook
- From `apps/storefront`:
  ```bash
  pnpm run storybook
  ```
- Open http://localhost:6006

Run tests
- Unit tests (vitest):
  ```bash
  pnpm test
  ```

Windows / PowerShell notes
- If `pnpm` scripts fail with script execution errors, run in cmd.exe or enable script execution for the current user:
  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
  ```
  Then re-open PowerShell.

Troubleshooting
- If you see TypeScript type errors about missing `vite/client` or vitest globals, run `pnpm install` from `apps/storefront` (the repo provides a pnpm lockfile).
- If files show as untracked (for example `.storybook` was untracked), commit them:
  ```bash
  git add apps/storefront/.storybook
  git commit -m "Add Storybook config"
  git push
  ```
