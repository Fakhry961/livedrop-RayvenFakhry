Component prompts log (what was asked of AI when scaffolding components):

- Product Card: "Generate a small product card component showing image, title, price, and Add to cart button using Tailwind classes"
- Assistant Panel: "Create a slide-over Ask Support panel UI with textarea, send button, and result area"
- Cart Line Item: "Render a cart line item with qty controls and remove button"

(Expand as you iterate.)
